# Overview

This repository is designed as a **hands‑on SOC analyst portfolio**, showing how Sysmon telemetry can be used to detect:

- Malware execution  
- Process injection  
- Persistence mechanisms  
- Network‑based threats  
- PowerShell abuse  
- Registry tampering  
- Evasion techniques  

It includes:

- **Step‑by‑step hunting guides**  
- **Practical investigations**  
- **TryHackMe‑based learning notes**  
- **Automation scripts for real SOC workflows**  
- **Visual diagrams**  
- **MITRE ATT&CK mappings**  

Everything here is built to reflect **real SOC analyst workflows**.

## What This Repository Demonstrates

### Real SOC Analyst Skills
Every hunt, script, and diagram is built to reflect real-world detection engineering and threat hunting.

### Sysmon Mastery
Deep understanding of:
- Event IDs  
- Telemetry relationships  
- Detection logic  
- Noise reduction  
- Pivoting between events  

### Automation
All hunts are backed by PowerShell automation scripts that replicate SOC workflows.

### Visual Storytelling
Diagrams help explain:
- Process injection  
- Persistence chains  
- Sysmon event flow  
- Hunting logic  

### MITRE ATT&CK Alignment
Each hunt maps to relevant ATT&CK techniques.

## Acknowledgment & Credit

This project was heavily inspired by hands‑on learning from **TryHackMe**, especially the excellent **Sysmon** room:

👉 [Tryhackme Sysmon Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/sysmon)

TryHackMe provided the foundation for:
- Understanding Sysmon event IDs  
- Building detection logic  
- Practicing real-world hunting scenarios  
- Strengthening SOC investigation skills  

Massive credit to their platform for enabling practical, accessible cybersecurity learning.

## Automation Scripts

The [/powershell](/powershell) folder contains SOC‑grade hunting tools:

- `hunt-process.ps1` — LOLBINs, suspicious parents, encoded commands  
- `hunt-network.ps1` — beaconing, DDNS, tunneling  
- `hunt-dns.ps1` — DGA, tunneling, system DNS  
- `hunt-registry.ps1` — autoruns, services, evasion keys  
- `hunt-injection.ps1` — remote threads, LSASS access, DLL loads  
- `hunt-persistence.ps1` — WMI, startup, services, Sysmon tampering  
- `hunt-powershell.ps1` — AMSI bypass, download cradles, lateral movement  
- `hunt-all.ps1` — full suite execution  

These scripts turn Sysmon logs into actionable intelligence.

## MITRE ATT&CK Coverage

This repo covers techniques across:
- Execution  
- Persistence  
- Privilege Escalation  
- Defense Evasion  
- Credential Access  
- Discovery  
- Lateral Movement  
- Command & Control  

See [/reference/mitre-mapping.md](/reference/mitre-mapping.md) for full mapping.

## Future Additions

- Sigma rule conversions  
- ELK dashboards  
- Sysmon config tuning examples  
- More TryHackMe investigation write-ups  
- Blue team lab scenarios  

---

## Contributions

Pull requests are welcome - especially improvements to:
- Detection logic  
- PowerShell scripts  
- Diagrams  
- Hunting workflows

## Stay Sharp, Stay Curious

This repo is built to show **practical, real-world SOC capability** — not theory.  
Every file exists because it solves a real detection or hunting problem.

**Happy hunting!**
